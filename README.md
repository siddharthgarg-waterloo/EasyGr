# EasyGr

## Project Description

This website allows users to input their grades and calculate their final GPA.

It also allows users to add a grade for the reamining weight to calculate the final grade as well as calculate grades required to achieve a certain final grade.

## Inspiration 

Being a student, such calculations are routine for me and hence I decided to learn web design while building something that I could use everyday.

## How I built it

**HTML, CSS, JS** 

## Challenges I ran into

**Web** - doing web design for the first time

**Deployment** - deploying on heroku for the first time
